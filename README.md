# Intro

This repo contains the code to run a Flask app locally to run AI powered self data analyst interviews.

### Problem

When I interviewed from my first data analyst job years ago, there were few resources online to practice.
I mostly had to rely on friends to make up interviews for me to practice my SQL and Python skills.
Things may have changed since then, but it would sure be nice to have an unlimited set of interviews to practice on!
